OOPS(Object Oriented Programming System):
    1. It is a concept which is used in programming languages.
    2. It is a way or methodoloy to write the code.
Class and Objects:
    1. class is a logical entity.
    2. class have properties(data member) and behaviour(methods)
    3. creating object with new keyword is that we can use class properties and methods.
Constructor:
    1. Constructor is used to initialize the data of the object.
    2. It will call automatically when we create an object or when we use new keyword.
    3. Properties of constructor:
        a. constructor name === className
        b. constructor does not return any value. not even void
        c. Public Student(){
            // This is non-parameterized constructor
        }.
        d. Public Student(int a, int b, String name){
            // This is parameterized constructor
        }.
        e. When java creates constructor automatically then only it is called as default constructor. If we don't have any constructor in our class then java will automatically create default one. 

constructor overloading:
    1. When we have more than one contructor in single class then it is called as constructor overloading.
    2. We can't create same construtor in a single class we have to add parameter to the constructor.
    3. We have to give number of argument different in on creating objects. So, when number of arguments and data type match then the specified constructor will be called.
    4. We can also change the type of argument.
    5. Order of argument may differ.

Method overloading:
    1. When we have multiple function with a same name then it is called as method overloading.
